2.1 â€“ The Purpose of Tanks in Honor of Kings

Tanks are the frontline protectors and engage specialists of the team. Their primary role is to soak up damage, initiate teamfights, and protect their carries (especially the Marksman and Mage). Tanks are not damage-focused, but their utility through crowd control (CC), zoning, and peeling can decide the outcome of a match.

Key responsibilities of a Tank:

Engage â€“ Start fights at the right moment to catch enemies off guard.

Peel â€“ Protect allies from assassins and divers.

Zone control â€“ Deny enemy access to objectives.

Vision provider â€“ Scout bushes and secure safe rotations.

Absorb damage â€“ Be the shield for your team, allowing carries to deal damage.

2.2 â€“ Tank Heroes in Global Server Meta (2025)
Hero	Strengths	Weaknesses	Meta Status
Zhang Fei	AoE knockback, huge shield ultimate, anti-dive	Weak early damage, ult timing crucial	Top-tier
Donghuang Taiyi	Unstoppable suppression ultimate, great peel	Squishy early game, mana reliant	Top-tier
Luban No. 7 (Tank build)	Flexible bruiser tank build, decent sustain	Weaker CC, scaling dependent	Niche pick
Luban Master	Long-range CC chains, versatile initiation	Can be punished when abilities on cooldown	Mid-tier
Luban Qi	Strong teamfight control, mobility disruption	Requires coordination	Mid-tier
Liu Shan	Mobile frontline, high CC, excellent tower dives	Less durable vs burst	Situational
Cai Yan (Tank build)	Good peel and speed buffs, flexible utility	Not a pure tank, low engage	Support-tank hybrid

(The exact roster varies by patch, but Zhang Fei and Donghuang Taiyi dominate the tank meta globally.)

ðŸ”¹ Other Tanks (Quick Notes)

Luban Master â€“ Long-range chains can engage from a distance; weak if whiffed.

Cai Yan (Tank/Support hybrid) â€“ Better as an enabler; peel-focused rotation with Marksman.

Luban No. 7 (Tank build) â€“ Situational bruiser tank when team needs frontline + damage.

2.4 â€“ Universal Tank Tips

Donâ€™t engage alone: Always ensure your carries can follow up.

Facecheck smartly: Scout bushes, but donâ€™t suicide without backup.

Track enemy spells: Wait for Purify/cleanse to be used before committing ultimates.

Itemization: Adaptâ€”if enemies have burst mages, build Magic Resist; vs Marksmen, prioritize Armor.

Timing: A tankâ€™s mistake can cost the fight; patience wins.
