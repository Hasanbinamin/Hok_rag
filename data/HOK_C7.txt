7.1 â€“ The Purpose of Supports in Honor of Kings

Supports are the backbone of team coordination in HOK. While they often donâ€™t top the kill charts, they dictate rotations, protect carries, and initiate fights. A strong support makes the team feel safe to play aggressively; a weak support leaves the backline vulnerable and objectives uncontested.

Core responsibilities:

Protect Marksman & Mage â€“ Peel against assassins and divers.

Engage & Disengage â€“ Start fights on your terms, or reset bad fights.

Vision & Map Control â€“ Secure bushes, protect jungle entrances.

Roaming & Rotations â€“ Move with Jungler to pressure lanes and secure objectives.

Utility & Buffs â€“ Healing, shields, speed boosts, and CC are all game-deciding.

7.7 â€“ Conclusion of Support Role

Supports are the unsung heroes of HOK. They might not deal the most damage, but they decide how fights start, how carries survive, and how objectives are secured. Whether you play a CC tank (Donghuang, Zhang Fei), a utility enabler (Sun Bin, Cai Yan), or an aggressive initiator (Liu Shan), the Support role requires constant awareness, unselfish play, and leadership.

A team with a great Support feels coordinated and safe; a team without one crumbles under pressure. Mastering Support makes you the true conductor of victory in Honor of Kings.
