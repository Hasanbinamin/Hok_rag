6.1 â€“ The Purpose of Marksmen in Honor of Kings

Marksmen are the primary late-game carries of HOK. Their role revolves around sustained DPS, usually from a safe backline position, and they are often the win condition for teams if games go long. A Marksmanâ€™s greatest strengths are tower sieging, consistent damage, and scaling, but they are also the most vulnerable roleâ€”positioning and protection are everything.

Core responsibilities:

Farm Priority â€“ Secure gold and items as fast as possible.

Tower Siege â€“ Safely chip down towers after wave clears.

Consistent DPS â€“ Carry fights with sustained damage, not burst.

Objective Pressure â€“ Secure Tyrant/Dark Slayer damage when safe.

Survival â€“ Stay alive at all costsâ€”dead Marksman = no damage.
