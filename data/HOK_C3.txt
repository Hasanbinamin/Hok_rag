3.1 – The Purpose of Warriors in Honor of Kings

Warriors are the bruisers and duelists of HOK. They balance between the durability of tanks and the damage of assassins, excelling in extended fights, split pushing, and skirmishes. A good Warrior can control the side lane, apply pressure, and either join teamfights or force enemy responses by pushing.

Core responsibilities:

Side Lane Control – Secure farm, deny enemy EXP, and control waves.

Dueling Power – Pressure squishies or peel for backline.

Split Push – Force enemies to deal with you, opening objectives for your team.

Secondary Engage – Follow up the Tank’s initiation.

Objective Control – Pressure Spirit Sentinel and Dark Slayer lane.
