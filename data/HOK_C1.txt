1.1 – What is Honor of Kings?

Honor of Kings (HOK) is a 5v5 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA), similar to League of Legends or Mobile Legends, but with its own distinct mechanics and balance. The goal is simple:

Destroy the enemy’s base crystal by pushing through lanes, killing towers, and controlling the map.

Map Layout

3 lanes: Top (Solo Lane), Mid (Mage Lane), Bottom (Duo Lane – Marksman + Support).

Jungle: Contains monsters, buffs, Tyrant, Spirit Sentinel, and Dark Slayer.

Objectives:

Tyrant (Dragon) – grants team gold/EXP buffs.

Spirit Sentinel – regen and lane push buff.

Dark Slayer – huge pushing buff and teamfight advantage.

1.2 – Roles in HOK

Every hero belongs to one or more roles. Mastering each role’s purpose is crucial.

Role	Lane / Position	Main Objective	Example Heroes
Tank	Roam/Frontline	Absorb damage, engage fights	Zhang Fei, Donghuang Taiyi
Warrior	Solo (Top Lane)	Duelists, bruisers, split push	Arthur, Guan Yu
Assassin	Jungle	Burst damage, pick squishy targets	Nakoruru, Han Xin
Mage	Mid Lane	Burst/AP damage, wave clear	Diao Chan, Zhuge Liang
Marksman	Duo Lane (Bot)	Main DPS, tower damage	Gongsun Li, Hou Yi
Support	Duo Lane (Bot)	Protect Marksman, vision, engage	Cai Yan, Sun Bin
1.3 – Win Conditions

Destroy towers – Each tower taken gives map control.

Secure objectives – Tyrant/Slayer buffs swing fights.

Snowball gold lead – Farm efficiency wins games.

Teamfight victories – Secure kills → push lanes → take objectives.

1.4 – Best Practices for All Players
1. Map Awareness

Always glance at minimap every 3–5 seconds.

Track enemy jungler spawn patterns.

Look for missing enemies → warn team.

2. Wave Management

Freeze wave near your tower if behind.

Fast push when enemy recalls/dies.

Slow push before objectives (stack waves).

3. Objective Priority

Towers > Tyrant > Dark Slayer > Kills.

Don’t chase kills if it means losing objectives.

4. Positioning

Squishy roles (Mage, Marksman) stay behind tank/warrior.

Tanks/Supports initiate; Assassins flank.

5. Communication

Use pings (attack, retreat, gather).

Call out enemy positions (“Jungler top”).

Rotate as 4–5 for Slayer fights.

1.5 – Global Server Meta Insights (2025)

Fast rotations → Junglers and Supports control tempo.

Objective snowballing → Early Tyrant fights are critical.

High mobility assassins (Han Xin, Nakoruru) dominate jungle.

Utility supports (Sun Bin, Donghuang) are meta picks.

Marksmen scaling (Hou Yi, Gongsun Li) often decide late game.
